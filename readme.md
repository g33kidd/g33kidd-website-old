This is my website, yes, all of it is here! Except you know, the secret stuff like keys and what-not.

My site is built with Laravel as the back-end and view rendering portion and there is also a VueJS backed web admin for creating posts, managing twitter posts and tons more!

Some things I have planned, just to learn a bit and just some general cool ideas:

- Import from WordPress.
- Store posts on Github.
- CLI to create posts using markdown, by passing in a file location then that would all be parsed when the user loads the page depending on the type of the post.
- A few more in the back of my head.

## Setup

I use Homestead.
